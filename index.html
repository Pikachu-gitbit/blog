                        <p>A computer virus, much like a flu virus, is designed to spread from host to host and has the
                            ability to replicate itself. Similarly, in the same way that flu viruses cannot reproduce
                            without a host cell, computer viruses cannot reproduce and spread without programming such
                            as a file or document.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In more technical terms, a computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to
                            alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A
                            virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that
                            supports macros in order to execute its code. In the process, a virus has the potential to
                            cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or
                            destroying data.
                        </p>
                        <p>The term "virus" is also misused by extension to refer to other types of malware. "Malware"
                            encompasses computer viruses along with many other forms of malicious software, such as
                            computer "worms", ransomware, spyware, adware, trojan horses, keyloggers, rootkits,
                            bootkits, malicious Browser Helper Object (BHOs), and other malicious software. The majority
                            of active malware threats are trojan horse programs or computer worms rather than computer
                            viruses. The term computer virus, coined by Fred Cohen in 1985, is a misnomer.[16] Viruses
                            often perform some type of harmful activity on infected host computers, such as acquisition
                            of hard disk space or central processing unit (CPU) time, accessing and stealing private
                            information (e.g., credit card numbers, debit card numbers, phone numbers, names, email
                            addresses, passwords, bank information, house addresses, etc.), corrupting data, displaying
                            political, humorous or threatening messages on the user's screen, spamming their e-mail
                            contacts, logging their keystrokes, or even rendering the computer useless. However, not all
                            viruses carry a destructive "payload" and attempt to hide themselves—the defining
                            characteristic of viruses is that they are self-replicating computer programs that modify
                            other software without user consent by injecting themselves into the said programs, similar
                            to a biological virus which replicates within living cells.

                            disk, or completely shutting down your system. They can also be used to steal
                            information,
                            harm computers and networks, create botnets, steal money, render advertisements, and
                            more. A
                            virus can copy itself and spread to other computers by attaching themselves to programs
                            and
                            executing code when a user runs the infected program. A computer virus requires human
                            action
                            to spread to other computers and are often spread through email attachments and internet
                            downloads.</p>

                    <p>One of the most common types of malware, worms spread over computer networks by exploiting
                        operating system vulnerabilities. It’s a standalone program that replicates itself to infect
                        other computers, without requiring action from anyone.

                    <p>
                        Since they can spread fast, worms are often used to execute a payload – a piece of code that
                        can cause damage to a system. Payloads can delete files on a host system, encrypt data for a
                        ransomware attack, steal information, delete files, and create botnet

                        are giving cyber criminals access to your system. This allows the cyber criminal to steal

                        <h1>use antivirus</h1>
                        <p>Antivirus software can be effective at combating basic, “non targeted" malware that might be
                            used by criminals against hundreds, or even thousands, of targets. However antivirus
                            software is usually ineffective against targeted attacks, such as the ones used by the
                            Chinese government hackers to compromise the New York Times. EFF recommends using antivirus
                            software on your computer and your smartphone, though we cannot recommend any particular
                            antivirus products as being superior to others.

                        </p>

                            be aware of suspicious attachments
                        </h1>
                        <p>The best way to avoid being infected with targeted malware is to avoid opening suspicious
                            documents and installing the malware in the first place. People with more computer and
                            technical expertise will have somewhat better instincts about what might be malware and what
                            might not be, but well-targeted attacks can be very convincing.</p>
                        <p>

                            If you are using Gmail, open suspicious attachments in Google Drive rather than downloading
                            them—this may protect your computer from infection. Using a less common computing platform,
                            like Ubuntu or ChromeOS, significantly improves your odds against many malware delivery
                            tricks, but will not protect against the most sophisticated adversaries</p>

                        <p>As new vulnerabilities are discovered in software, companies can fix those problems and offer
                            that fix as a software update, but you will not reap the benefits of their work unless you
                            install the update on your computer. It is a common belief that if you are running an
                            unregistered copy of Windows, you cannot or should not accept security updates. This is not
                            true.</p>
